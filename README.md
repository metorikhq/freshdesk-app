## Metorik

Metorik is an all-in-one analytics solution for WooCommerce stores, unifying your store's orders, customers, and products through brilliant reports and a blazing fast interface.

Metorik offers countless features that help you run your store and make more informed decisions like:

* Segmenting/filtering
* Digests
* Order reports & management
* Customer profiles
* Product insights & reports
* Unlimited team members
* Integrations with other products like Google Analytics, Slack & Freshdesk
* So much more... (really!)

Metorik offers a 2-way integration with Freshdesk that's included for free with your Metorik account. The Metorik app for Freshdesk pulls in customer and guest data from Metorik into Freshdesk so you can get a better understanding of the customer you're talking to, including:

* Customer Profile
* Customer LTV
* Customer Average Order
* Customer Orders/Items Count
* Order History
* Products Owned

It takes moments to set up and doesn't affect your live store at all. Even if your live store was temporarily offline, the app will still work and you'll continue having access to your store's data!

You can also connect your Freshdesk account in Metorik itself, which brings in related Freshdesk tickets for a customer or order and lets you create new Freshdesk tickets with a customer straight from Metorik.

### Instructions

Firstly, make sure that you have a store set up on [Metorik](https://metorik.com).

**For Metorik's Freshdesk App:** When you install the app, you'll be asked for a token. You can get this from your store's [Metorik integration settings](https://app.metorik.com/settings/stores/current?area=integrations). Copy the token over into the app's Freshdesk settings.

**For connecting Freshdesk in Metorik:** Go to your store's [Metorik integration settings](https://app.metorik.com/settings/stores/current?area=integrations) and follow the steps to connect it using your Freshdesk API key.
